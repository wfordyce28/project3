    <p>Sometime this year the two thousandth planet will be discovered outside our solar
        system. The vast range of discoveries that have been confirmed are almost certainly
        outliers in the billions of worlds thought to exist, brought into focus by relatively
        weak technologies that are biased in favor of anomalies. So far, these include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the burnt cinder of PSR B1257+12 B, whirling around a pulsar: the first exoplanet, discovered in 1992.
        <li>massive “hot Jupiters” that circle their stars well inside the orbit of Mercury,
    drawing bow wakes of stellar material behind them.
        <li>Systems with seven detected planets (HD 10180).
    </ul>
    <h2>Discovery Techniques</h2>
    <img src="miridian-VI-square.jpg" class="planet-wrap" alt="Artist's impression of the exoplanet Miridian VI">
    <p>Pulsar timing remains the easiest method to find exoplanets, but the inimical nature of their parent stars
        the worlds extremely unlikely candidates as sources for life. More recent detection techniques have
        their own limitations:</p>
    <h3>Radial velocity</h3>
    <p>The measurement of a planet’s orbital tug on its star, causing a rhythmic “wobble” in the position
        of the parent star. Due to their differences in mass, the technique is best at detecting exoplanets
        that are very large (Jupiter mass or above) and/or very close to their star.</p>
    <h3>Transit</h3>
    <p>A exoplanet moving in the same plane as our line of sight will partially “eclipse” its star
        during moments of its orbit. If this dip in perceived brightness occurs at regular intervals,
        an orbiting body can be inferred. Obviously the larger the planet and/or the further it orbits
        from its star, the greater the dip in received light and the easier the detection.</p>
    <h3>Reflected light</h3>
    <p>A planet will reflect the light of its star in phases as it orbits, just as the moon does as it circles
        the Earth. While the amount of reflected light will be very small compared to the central star (the
        common comparison is the ability to perceive the glow of a lit match held at arms length from a
        lighthouse beam), the method is useful for large Jupiter-sized bodies orbiting relatively
        close to their host star.</p>
    <h3>Gravitational microlensing</h3>
    <p>Light can be bent by its transmission medium (such as water) or by passing beside a large
        gravitational mass. The most extreme variations of the latter effect are observed around
        supermassive black holes and galaxies, but planets have the same effect on starlight, albeit much more subtly.</p>
    <p>Because such alignments of exoplanets and background stars are very rare, the most likely
        opportunities come from observations directed toward the galactic core, where the density of stars is highest.</p>
    <p>Exoplanet detection is a long, slow process: a candidate will need to complete at least one
    full orbit (its own relative “year”) before it can be confirmed. While terrestrial equipment
    has been used in the hunt for planets, the greatest gains in exoplanet detection have come
    from satellites, particularly the Kepler <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr>
    space observatory and <abbr title="COnvection ROtation et Transits planétaires; English: COnvection
    ROtation and planetary Transits">COROT</abbr> (led by the French Space Agency). Other projects with
    greater resolution, such as the Terrestrial Planet Finder and Darwin, are unfortunately on hold or
    cancelled at this time. The <a href="http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, a
    visible-wavelength-to-infrared detector, should also have the opportunity for imaging planets
        after it is launched in 2018.</p>
    <h2>Possible Detection of Life?</h2>
    <p>So far we have have a dataset of just one planet confirmed to support life: we know it exists on
        Earth. The flourishing evolutionary diversity of life on Earth is entirely dependant on water,
        which implies that other planets capable of supporting biological life must be within the
        “habitable zone” of their parent stars (neither so close as to boil, or freezing when they
        are too far out). Other heating methods to produce liquid water are possible, from vulcanism
        to the gravitational tugging of a large planet on a smaller ice-covered worldlet, seen in Saturn’s
        moons Enceladus and <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/science/moons/mimas/">Mimas</a>.</p>

         alien city in a crater" id="occupied">
    <p>While projects such as <abbr title="Search for Extraterrestial Life">SETI</abbr> have
    so far failed to detect the presence of intelligent extraterrestrial life using radio
    frequencies, there exists the intriguing possibility that we may detect intelligent life by
        observing the atmosphere of an exoplanet.</p>
    <p>Such detection is not likely to be achieved by seeing the night-glow of an alien city through
    a telescope: the power to resolve those kinds of details is more than a century away, if it is
        achievable at all. Rather, alien life might be inferred through the presence of elements, via spectrography.</p>
    <p>As a planet transits past its parent star, light is refracted through its atmosphere. By
    teasing apart the spectrum of the light received here on Earth and observing the absorption
    lines, it is possible to determine the chemical composition of a planet’s atmosphere, together
    with information like wind speed and direction. As our instruments become more precise, we
    should be able to resolve the atmospheres of ever-smaller planets… and if we ever find oxygen,
    or a high proportion of methane, we will have found life, as it is only biological life that
        can produce those elements.</p>
    <p>Taking this a step further, we should also be able to detect the presence of artificial
    chemicals in an atmosphere, such as vinyl chloride mononomers. This will be an unmistakable
        sign of an industrial society, as no natural process that produces such compounds.</p>
    <p>Given the increasingly desperate state of our own planet’s ecosystem, it is deeply ironic
    that our discovery of intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe may come from the detection of
    another world’s pollution.</p>
